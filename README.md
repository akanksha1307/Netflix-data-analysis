## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    - We started by cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and standardize data formats.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Analyzed the distribution of movies and TV shows.
    - Examined the trend of content additions over the years.
    - Identified the most prolific directors and actors featured on Netflix.
    - Explored the distribution of content ratings and durations.
## Visualization:
    - Created visualizations to highlight key trends and patterns, such as the growth of Netflix's content library, popular genres, and country-wise contributions.
## Power BI Dashboard:
    - Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to allow users to explore the dataset visually. The dashboard includes filters for different genres, countries, and years, providing a dynamic way to understand the data.
